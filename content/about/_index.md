### According to others
A collaborator:
>I am Jord Liu. \
\
I am good at making music – I have the skills to take the abstract feelings in my head and translate them to a wide variety of instruments (the right one for the task at hand) almost instantly.\
\
What makes me stand out is my relentless desire to search for truths in the smallest or biggest ways. I always ask why, and when what I learn is unsatisfying, I take it upon myself to dig deeper and keep going.\
\
I am passionate about understanding how my identities shape the way I look at the world, and sharing my perspective with those that I love.

My brother:
>Hello, my name is Jordan Liu. I am passionate about the intersection of engineering and art. I believe that the two strengthen each other rather than being distinct. In addition to being passionate, I am also good at both! I’ve succeeded academically and in industry, graduating with a CS degree from the University of Michigan and working for 5 years as a software engineer at Google. I’ve also written an award-winning musical, performed live jazz concerts in SF, and can improvise on pretty much any musical tune or theme.\
\
I am thoughtful above all else - I stand strongly for my principles. If I make an argument, I’ll accept and live out the consequences of that belief fully. On a similar note, I’ll go really far for the joke. When I have a decision to make, an important factor to me is how funny the end result will be.\
\
I care deeply about cultivating an intimate and honest community around me. I can’t stand to see callousness between people that I love, and will work hard to bridge the gaps that I see between others. Working with others to achieve a shared goal and vision brings out the best in me - I am energized by collaboration.

My partner:
>Hi, Jord Liu here!\
\
I am passionate above all about creativity in its many forms, excelling at what I do, and connecting with the people around me. I love to write, sing, tell jokes, play music, and figure out difficult engineering problems.\
\
I am good at holding myself to all kinds of promises, including schedules I set for myself and my work. In states of creative flow, I am usually bursting with ideas that are compelling to me and I can precisely explain how they fit (or don't!) in a piece's underlying logic, motivations, and vision.\
\
In discussion and conflict, I prioritize meeting other people where they're at to work toward a solution. With that also comes profound curiosity, empathy, and interest in others' thriving. My smile also lights up the room.\
\
I stand out in that I write without shame, I learn quickly, and I am an absolute firecracker!
