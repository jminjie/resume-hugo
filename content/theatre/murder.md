A writeup of an escape room and murder mystery party.
<!--more-->

"Murder at the Cricket Lab" is an escape room and murder mystery party that I hosted in my apartment for Halloween in 2019. I wrote the storyline, the characters, and designed a series of escape room and scavenger hunt style puzzles for the guests to solve in under an hour in order to solve the murder.
