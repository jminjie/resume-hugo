Lyrics:

Glacier mice
they roll and roll around on the ice
those mossy balls of fun
they're never done
although they're not real mice they're on the run
one by one

they shuffle
exposing
each part to the sun

they tumble
together
but nobody knowsâ€¨
how they move
how they move
how they move
how they move

"Wow, that sure is mysterious, Jordan"
"Ha-ha! I'll say!"

it's not the wind
it's not the icy slope
it's not the sun
icelandic science only knows it's dope
but we have hope
nobody suspects
one theory suggests

the physics
the heat of
the surface of the glacier

they think theres
a pattern
but nobody knows
how they move
how they move
how they move
how they move

glacier mice
are little balls of algae
rolling around in
Alaska

glacier mice
glaciologists are happy
to answer any question
you'll ask 'em
except for...

how they move
how they move
how they move (oooh the way you move boi)
how they move
those glacier mice
```
