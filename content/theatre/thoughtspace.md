“Thoughtspace” is a new, two-person show that draws comparisons between concepts in mathematics and lessons in life and love.

<!--more-->

“Thoughtspace” follows the love story of Laya, a tenure-track mathematics professor, and Hannah-Christine, a nerdy punk musician. Both characters must grapple with the challenge of building and discovering their futures while simultaneously figuring out their end goals, and ultimately stare down the scary prospect of starting fresh when they’ve already “made it” once.
