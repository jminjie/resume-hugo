What does it feel like to be watched?

"Don't look at me" is a short online experience exploring surveillance. See the live demo [here](https://look.jminjie.com/)

The site simply records you through your webcam while you are looking. Then when you look away, it plays what it recorded, resulting in a surreal and often humorous game.
