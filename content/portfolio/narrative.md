Just a plain website. (A ten minute interactive experience about online narratives.)
<!--more-->

What makes people supportive or dismissive of social movements? How does online communication shape public opinion? NARRATIVE is a collaborative experience which explores these questions and more.

Thatâ€™s all there is to it, we have no secret nefarious goals.

### Background
On June 4th, 1989, the Chinese government ordered 300,000 troops to forcibly stop student protests for democracy, freedom of speech, and freedom of press at Tiananmen Square. Thousands were killed and tens of thousands were injured. In the days following, the government used its surveillance network to identify those involved in the protest and arrested hundreds of thousands of people across the country. To this day, the government denies any wrongdoing, saying that the protests were put up by Western forces trying to weaken China for political gain.

In June of 2020 in the United States, Black Lives Matter protests for racial equity hit their peak. Different news outlets wrote headlines with wildly varying sentiments, and these headlines propogated through social media to create complex overlapping online narratives.

NARRATIVE is a collaborative experience which showcases how these online narratives are built.

### Christopher Chen's CAUGHT
Christopher Chen's CAUGHT is a play about negation and lying to the audience. NARRATIVE was created in tribute to the show, on comission by the Bay Area's Shotgun Players for their 30/30 initiative.
