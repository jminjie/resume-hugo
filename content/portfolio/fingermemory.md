#### About

"Finger Memory" explores the gap between conscious and habituated musical intention. The keys of the piano are laid out backwards from a regular piano so that the high notes become low notes and the low notes become high notes.

Jord also performed on the backwards piano at Canessa as part of Ready Box, an experimental music concert.
