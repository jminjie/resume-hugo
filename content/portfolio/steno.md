A cheap and playable prototype that allows you to create poetry that is
simultaneously music.

The musical stenotype was prototyped for the Hindes 2022 Prototyping Festival
at the Exploratorium. It combines a MIDI keyboard along with stenography theory
to produce novel compositions.

#### About
A stenotype is a specialty keyboard commonly used for courtroom transcriptions
and live captioning which allows typists to achieve 200-300 wpm speeds. This is
achieved through typing multiple keys at the same time. Specifically, the left
hand types sounds at the beginning of a word, the thumbs type sounds in the
middle of the word, and the right hand types sounds at the end of the word, all
simultaneously. To type the word "cat" for instance, you would hold down a K on
the left, an A in the middle, and a T on the right, and when you let go of the
three keys, the word would be inputted.

Unstressed parts of a word can also be omitted, allowing you to type
multi-syllabic words in a single stroke.

For the missing letters on the keyboard there are special key combinations. For
instance, pressing E and U together gives you I. Pressing TKPW gives you J.
Stenographic theory is customizable and tends to be a combination of phonetic
rules and memorization.

The musical stenotype I invented is a combination of a stenotype and a piano
keyboard. Real stenotypes cost upwards of $3000 while a 2 octave MIDI keyboard
costs $40. We can map the keys of a stenotype directly onto such a MIDI
keyboard as shown here.

Now we have a cheap playable USB stenotype. As an added bonus, each keypress
also plays a piano tone which means your brain forms more associations as it
learns to type. You might notice that a word is misspelled when it doesn't
match the musical chord you expect.

Since steno is mostly phonetic, chords which sound similar produce similar
sounding words. If you play two chords where the left hand is slightly
different, you get two words with similar ending sounds but different beginning
sounds. In other words, rhyme. Similarly two chords where the right hand is
slightly different gives you words with the same beginning but different
ending, which results in alliteration.

In this way, the musical stenotype now allows you to compose pieces that are
both poems that you write with steno, and musical pieces that you listen to.
