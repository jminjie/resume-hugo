An experiment in shared online spaces.
<!--more-->

"Leave the Light off" shows a light switch which can be flipped up and down, and a small note telling the user to leave the light off. The switch is shared between all users of the website, so if you leave the light on, it will stay on for all users until someone turns it off.
