TypeByke is a local 0-2 player game that combines Tron and Scrabble.
<!--more-->

The game is available to play online [here](TODO).

You can also browse the source [here](https://github.com/jminjie/typebike).

#### Watch the making-of:

TypeByke was made over a 5-day span, and we took demo videos at the end of each day. Watch as our AI slowly becomes totally dominant and eventually removes the need for human players.
