### About the show
!["Baked! The Musical" Poster](/img/portfolio/res/bakedposter.png)

When she doesn’t receive the scholarship that would send her to her dream school, habitual overachiever Jane Huang, with the help of her best friend, joins forces with the class degenerate to build the greatest drug empire ever run by high schoolers. Kept in the dark are Jane’s parents, whose inability to cope with their daughter leaving for college while maintaining a profit at their struggling Chinese bakery drives them to pry and potentially unravel Jane’s web of lies.

Baked! The Musical is a reflection on perfectionism, self worth, and the question of what we owe the people we love. It features an all Asian American cast, and the themes are born out of the writers’ own experiences growing up as the children of immigrants in the US.

### Press
* "Rife with laughter and crackling with charisma, this musical burns with fiery grooves and tuneful melodies. Sleek, charming, and razor-sharp, this raucous journey of family and friendship from a far-underrepresented perspective, Baked! is certain to win the ears and hearts of any and all audiences." – Chicagoland Musical Theatre

* "The laid back humor in the dialogue and the emotional music are the two big strengths of this show. They have all the ingredients here for a really great little musical about the choices we make and the values which we hold important." – Times Square Chronicles
