"Upgrade" your hyperlinks into Superlinks with this Chrome extension.

<!--more-->
Superlinks is a Google Chrome extension which "upgrades" your hyperlinks into Superlinks (blue underlined text that is also now unclickable).

Why would you want this? I'm not sure.

![Demo](/img/portfolio/res/superlinks_demo.gif)
