"Upgrade" your hyperlinks into Superlinks.

<!--more-->
Superlinks is a Google Chrome extension which "upgrades" your hyperlinks into Superlinks (blue underlined text that is also now unclickable).

Why would you want this? I'm not sure.

Get the extension [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/superlinks/ildidgmdkfaldcfogkghghkbgjkbhflm) and see a short demo or explore the source [here](https://github.com/jminjie/superlink).
